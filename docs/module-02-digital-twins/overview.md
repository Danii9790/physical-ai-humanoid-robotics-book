# Module 2: Digital Twins

## Simulation and Visualization

Welcome to Module 2, where you'll learn to create virtual replicas of physical robots. Digital twins allow you to develop, test, and refine complex robotic systems in safe, repeatable virtual environments before deployment to hardware.

## Module Overview

Developing and testing humanoid robots in the physical world can be costly, time-consuming, and potentially hazardous. This module introduces **digital twins** – dynamic virtual counterparts that mirror physical robots' state, behavior, and environment.

### What You'll Learn

- **Digital twin concepts** and their role in robotics
- **Gazebo** for physics-based simulation
- **Unity** for high-fidelity visualization
- **URDF/XACRO** robot modeling
- **Sensor simulation** (cameras, LiDAR, IMU)
- **Environment design** and interaction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

✅ Explain the concept and benefits of digital twins in robotics  
✅ Create robot models using URDF and XACRO formats  
✅ Set up physics-based simulations in Gazebo  
✅ Develop high-fidelity visualizations in Unity  
✅ Simulate common robot sensors with realistic data  
✅ Design virtual environments for testing robot behaviors  
✅ Integrate digital twins with ROS 2 control systems  

## Why Digital Twins?

Digital twins provide critical advantages in robotics development:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Safety** | Test dangerous scenarios without risk |
| **Speed** | Iterate faster than physical prototyping |
| **Cost** | Avoid hardware damage and replacement costs |
| **Repeatability** | Run identical tests multiple times |
| **Scalability** | Test with multiple robots simultaneously |
| **Accessibility** | Develop without physical hardware access |
