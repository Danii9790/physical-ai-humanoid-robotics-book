# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to Module 1, where you'll learn the foundation of modern robotics software development. The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) serves as the "nervous system" of our humanoid robots, enabling communication and coordination between various components.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will explore:

- **ROS 2 Architecture** - Understanding the distributed system design
- **Nodes** - The functional building blocks of robot software
- **Topics** - Real-time data streaming mechanisms
- **Services** - Request-response communication patterns
- **Actions** - Goal-oriented task execution with feedback

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

✅ Explain the core architecture of ROS 2 and its advantages over ROS 1  
✅ Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for specific robotic tasks  
✅ Implement publish-subscribe communication using topics  
✅ Design and use services for synchronous operations  
✅ Utilize actions for complex, long-running tasks with feedback  
✅ Structure modular robot software using ROS 2 packages  

## Why ROS 2?

The Robot Operating System has become the de facto standard in robotics research and development. ROS 2, the latest iteration, offers significant improvements:

- **Real-time capabilities** - Better support for time-critical operations
- **Security** - Built-in DDS security features
- **Multi-platform support** - Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Improved reliability** - Better suited for production environments
- **Scalability** - Efficient communication for large robot systems

## Module Structure

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence
Understand the fundamental concepts that distinguish Physical AI from digital AI and explore the role of embodied intelligence in robotics.

### Chapter 2: The Robotic Nervous System – ROS 2 Fundamentals
Deep dive into ROS 2 architecture, learning how to build modular, distributed robot software systems.

## Assessment: ROS 2 Package Project

This module culminates in a hands-on project where you'll design and implement a ROS 2 package containing multiple nodes that communicate using topics, services, and/or actions to perform a robotic task.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Proper ROS 2 package structure
- Clear node responsibilities and separation of concerns
- Robust communication between nodes
- Well-documented code and architecture

## Time Allocation

**Weeks 1-3** of the 13-week course schedule

- **Week 1:** Course introduction, Physical AI concepts, embodied intelligence
- **Week 2:** ROS 2 core concepts - nodes, topics, workspaces
- **Week 3:** Services, actions, and ROS 2 package development

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Access to Ubuntu 22.04 (native, VM, or WSL2)
- ROS 2 Humble or later installed (installation guides available in course resources)

## Next Steps
